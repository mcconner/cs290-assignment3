Tasks: During this period I spent time going over the requirements of the assignment and drawing out how I think the parseGit function should work.

Tasks: During this time I worked on the bar and parseGit functions. I was able to get the bar function to work, but I was stuck on parseGit.

Tasks: I worked more on the parseGit function. It is working correctly when I test it in a web browser but it does not pass the tests on the testing template.

Tasks: After getting feedback from my instructor about the parseGit function, I began working on it again. It now passes all tests.

Tasks: I went back to the objects.js file and began working on the MessageLog functions more. I am still working on the logMessage method but I have made a lot of progress.

Start: Fri, 17 Apr 2015 13:40:00 -0700
End: Fri, 17 Apr 2015 14:27:22 -0700
Tasks: I worked more on the MessageLog object and creating methods that work. I wrote out my design for the logMessage method on paper, then tried it in the assignment. After a bit of debugging, all of the tests pass!

Tasks: I went over the requirements of part 2 of the assignment and started watching lecture videos.

Start: Tue, 21 Apr 2015 17:00:00 -0700
End: Tue, 21 Apr 2015 20:00:00 -0700
Tasks: I continued watching lecture videos, completing the readings for the week, and began working on part 2.

Start: Wed, 22 Apr 2015 16:00:00 -0700
End: Wed, 22 Apr 2015 22:00:00 -0700
Tasks: I continued working on part 2. At the very end of this time, I was finally able to make a connection and access gists. I have had no luck with language.

Start: Thu, 23 Apr 2015 08:30:00 -0700
End: Thu, 23 Apr 2015 10:30:00 -0700
Tasks: This morning, I was finally able to get gists to display in the console, but I can't get more then 1 to display on my page.

Tasks: I spent 8 hours working on this project today. I ran into some issues with adding to favorites and removing. Everytime something is removed from favorites, another favorites list is created (rather than having the new list replace the old). I am also only able to add one item to favorites at a time.

Start: Sat, 25 Apr 2015 09:00:00 -0700
End: Sat, 25 Apr 2015 10:30:00 -0700
Tasks: I worked on fixing the add to favorites and remove from favorites buttons. I am now able to add multiple items to favorites and display them correctly. The remove button also works.

Start: Sat, 25 Apr 2015 18:30:00 -0700
End: Sat, 25 Apr 2015 20:00:00 -0700
Tasks: I worked on cleaning up my code and trying to make it so that when an item is added to favorites, it no longer shows up in search results.
